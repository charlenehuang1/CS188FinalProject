# CS 188 Final Project: Hand Tracking for Pick-Up Tasks in Robosuite
by Charlene Huang, Alexis Lee, and Daniel Chvat 

Our project uses hand tracking with a web camera and translates physical actions onto the Panda robot arm in Robosuite.
To run handtracking.py, make sure you have Python 3.10. 
Create a virtual environment and install mediapipe and opencv-python.
