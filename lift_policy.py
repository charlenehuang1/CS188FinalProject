class LiftPolicy(object):
    """
    A simple PID-based policy for a robotic arm to lift an object in three phases:
    1. Move above the object.
    2. Lower to grasp the object.
    3. Lift the object.

    The policy uses a PID controller to drive the robot's end-effector to a sequence of target positions
    while managing the gripper state based on the current phase of motion.

        Initialize the LiftPolicy with the first observation from the environment.

        Args:
            obs (dict): Initial observation from the environment. Must include:
